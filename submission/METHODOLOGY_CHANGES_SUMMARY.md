## Key Improvements

### Before → After

**Before**: "We use ResNet-18 with 512 channels"
**After**: "ResNet-18 (22.87M parameters) comprises four residual stages with channel dimensions [64, 128, 256, 512], utilizing basic residual blocks containing two convolutional layers each [1]. The adoption of ResNet architectures was motivated by several factors. First, residual connections enable training of deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem..."

**Before**: "Middle fusion works better"
**After**: "Middle fusion represents an intermediate approach wherein each modality is processed through dedicated encoder branches, with integration occurring at the feature map level [34, 35]. This strategy has demonstrated strong performance across various multi-modal tasks including RGB-D object recognition [36]... Empirically, middle fusion consistently achieved superior validation performance across our experimental configurations, corroborating findings from multi-modal learning literature [27, 47]."
